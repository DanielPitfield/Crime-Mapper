### Known Issues ###  
* IE11 is not supported
* Not responsive for mobile devices 
* Larger resolutions (above 1920x1080) are untested
* API Key is visible (key is restricted to website domain with quota limits)

**Note:** This repository was imported from GitLab.  

Sensitive information such as the password for the database user and (albeit to a lesser extent) the API key were changed prior to the import process (therefore any previous commits show only out-of-date information and the currently hosted solution uses different information that has not been made publicly visible).
